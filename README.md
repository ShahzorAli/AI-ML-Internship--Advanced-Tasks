This repository contains AI/ML internship tasks demonstrating end-to-end machine learning workflows, including classical ML pipelines and multimodal deep learning.

Task 1: Fine tuning Bert-Uncased Model

# BERT News Topic Classifier

This project fine-tunes a **BERT (`bert-base-uncased`)** model to classify news headlines from the **AG News dataset** into 4 categories:

- World  
- Sports  
- Business  
- Sci/Tech  

A **Gradio interface** is provided for real-time predictions.

---

## 📌 Objective
Fine-tune a transformer-based model for **news topic classification**, and deploy a lightweight interactive UI for testing headlines.

---

## 🗂 Dataset
**AG News** dataset (Hugging Face Datasets):

- Training set: 120,000 news headlines  
- Test set: 7,600 news headlines  
- Categories: World, Sports, Business, Sci/Tech

For fast training in this project, a **subset of 8,000 training examples** and **2,000 test examples** is used.

---

## 🛠 Methodology
1. **Tokenization:** Using `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, max length 128  
2. **Model:** `BertForSequenceClassification` (num_labels=4)  
3. **Fine-tuning:**  
   - Learning rate: 2e-5  
   - Batch size: 16  
   - Epochs: 2  
   - Optimizer: AdamW with weight decay 0.01  
4. **Evaluation:** Accuracy and weighted F1-score  
5. **Deployment:** Gradio interface for live predictions
